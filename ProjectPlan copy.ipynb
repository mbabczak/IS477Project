    "I will be working independently for this project. Below, I will outline the steps that I will take and be responsible for. \n",
    "##### Data Lifecycle: \n",
    "- Plan and ensure the project follows a data lifecycle (Data collection, cleaning, integration, analysis, visualizations, workflow automation, and documentation) \n",
    "##### Ethical Data Handling: \n",
    "- I will gather the dataset, ensuring reliable access in the future and ensure that it follows legal/ethical sharing guidelines. \n",
    "##### Data Collection and Acquistion \n",
    "- Find 2 datasets from different, trustworthy sources. Ensure each datasets is accessed in a different way (CVS, API Key)\n",
    "##### Storage and Organization: \n",
    "- Design a storage strategy to allow other users to replicate the exploration and analysis I conducted. \n",
    "##### Extraction and Enrichment\n",
    "- Prepare data by ensuring column naming makes sense and transforming data types if necessary (If necessary, I will use a OneHotEncoder to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. ) \n",
    "##### Data Integration: \n",
    "- Integrate 2 datasets and ensure the data is properly mapped. \n",
    "##### Data Quality: \n",
    "- Ensure data is high quality and identify possible problem areas (missing values, incomplete values, etc)\n",
    "##### Data Cleaning:\n",
    "- Apply cleaning methods to data such as imputing, standardizing, duplicates, etc.  \n",
    "##### Workflow Automation and Provenance:\n",
    "- Provide an end-to-end view of the steps taken to achieve the results so far. \n",
    "##### Reproducibility and Transparency: \n",
    "- Outline each step taken to ensure I am being transparent in what I've done and allow for other users to recreate the process I did. \n",
    "##### Metadata and Data Documentation:\n",
    "-  I will ensure to complete all necessary documents, upload them to the correct place (GitHub Repo) and update this plan as I recieve feedback from the course staff. I will also be in charge of delivering the final report including the findings from this project. "
